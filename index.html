            <p>My name is Cezar Ganzon Jr. I was born on March 4, 1995 in San Diego, CA. I have lived in San Diego
                all
                my life and I plan to keep it that way because the weather is great here! I love computers and I
                consider myself a big gamer (PC master race). I also like to skateboard, snowboard, play guitar,
                ukulele, and eat food (especially Filipino food).</p>

            <p id="clear">Buildings things is something that I really like to do on my spare time. I've built model kits,
                instruments, wooden swords, mini catapults, and many other things. On that same note, I believe web
                development is a perfect occupation for me because it allows you to be creative and to build elegant
                and
                complex web applications. The thought of possibly being able to create websites like Amazon,
                Youtube,
                Facebook, etc. is exciting to me and it makes me hope that one day I could take part in building an
                amazing web application as well.</p>
